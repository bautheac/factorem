```{r `load`, include = FALSE}
library(factorem)
```


factorem belongs to the [finRes](https://bautheac.github.io/finRes/) suite where it facilitates asset pricing research and factor investment back-testing.  
The package is organised around a workhorse function and a series of wrappers for asset pricing factors popular in the literature. These functions get raw financial data retrieved from Bloomberg using the [pullit](https://bautheac.github.io/pullit/) package and return S4 objects that carry data belonging to the corresponding factor including positions and return time series. See the eponym vignette for details: `vignette("factorem", package = "factorem")`.
